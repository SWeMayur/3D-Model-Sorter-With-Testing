# 3D Model Sorter Project

## Overview

The 3D Model Sorter project is a C++ application developed using the Qt framework and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. It utilizes the OpenGL library for rendering 3D models and incorporates a sorting mechanism. The project includes test cases written with Google Test to ensure the functionality and reliability of the implemented features.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering:** Utilizes OpenGL for rendering 3D models.
- **Sorting Mechanism:** Implements a sorting algorithm to organize 3D models.
- **Test Cases:** Comprehensive test suite using Google Test to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed before setting up and building the project:

- [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/download)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [OpenGL library](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [Google Test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) (for running test cases)

## Setup and Build

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SWeMayur/3d-model-sorter.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

3. Configure Qt in your Visual Studio project.

4. Build the project.

## Usage

1. Run the built executable to launch the 3D Model Sorter application.

2. Use the application to load and manipulate 3D models.

3. Explore the sorting mechanism to organize the loaded models.

## Running Tests

1. Ensure that the Google Test framework is properly set up.

2. Build and run the test suite to validate the functionality of the project.

    ```bash
    ./run_tests
    ```
